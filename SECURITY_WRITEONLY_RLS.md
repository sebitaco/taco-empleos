# Write-Only RLS Security Implementation

## Summary
Both the `waitlist` and `job_postings` tables now implement write-only security. This means:
- Anonymous users can ONLY submit data (INSERT)
- NO ONE can read the submitted data except admins with service role
- Complete privacy of all submitted information (emails, phone numbers, personal data)

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. Waitlist Table
**Migration:** `0027_waitlist_write_only_security.sql`
- Removes ALL SELECT permissions from `anon` role
- Only allows INSERT with validation
- API route updated to use `{ returning: 'minimal' }`

### 2. Job Postings Table  
**Migration:** `0026_private_job_postings_rls.sql`
- Write-only access for anonymous submissions
- Forces all submissions to 'pending' status
- API route uses `{ returning: 'minimal' }`

## How to Apply in Supabase SQL Editor

Run these migrations in order:

```sql
-- 1. First apply the job postings write-only security
-- Run the contents of: supabase/migrations/0026_private_job_postings_rls.sql

-- 2. Then apply the waitlist write-only security
-- Run the contents of: supabase/migrations/0027_waitlist_write_only_security.sql
```

## Why This Approach is Secure

1. **No Data Exposure**: Without SELECT permissions, submitted data cannot be read by any public user
2. **Minimal Return**: Using `{ returning: 'minimal' }` prevents Supabase from trying to SELECT after INSERT
3. **Admin Only Access**: Only service role (admin dashboard) can read submissions
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security including RLS, GRANT/REVOKE, and API configuration

## Testing After Migration

1. Submit a test form (should succeed)
2. Try to query the table directly (should fail with permission denied)
3. Verify admin dashboard can still read data (with service role)

## Important Notes

- The SELECT policy that was causing security concerns has been completely removed
- This is the most secure approach for form submissions that need moderation
- Admin interface must use service role key to access data
